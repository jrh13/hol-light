Highlighted theorems:

e_is_irrational (1744 Euler):
  ~(cexp (Cx (&1)) IN QinC)

e_is_transcendental (1873 Hermite):
  ~algebraic_number (cexp (Cx (&1)))

pi_is_transcendental (1882 Lindemann):
  ~algebraic_number (Cx pi)

transcendental_if_exp_nonzero_algebraic (1882 Lindemann):
  algebraic_number a
  /\ algebraic_number (cexp a)
  ==> a = Cx (&0)

zero_sum_algebraic_exp_algebraic (1882 Lindemann):

    S SUBSET algebraic_number /\
    (forall s. s IN S ==> algebraic_number (B s)) /\
    ring_sum complex_ring S (\s. B s * cexp s) = Cx (&0)
    ==> (forall s. s IN S ==> B s = Cx (&0))

Traditional Greek presentation of the last theorem:
if sum_α β_α exp α = 0,
where each α is algebraic and each β_α is algebraic,
then each β_α = 0.
This easily implies the other highlighted theorems.

Some of the proofs below act as sanity checks on the definitions
(e.g., algebraic_number_QinC; algebraic_number_ii).
Another sanity check would be to prove that,
for reals, the definition of algebraic numbers here
is equivalent to the definition in 100/liouville.ml,
which internally uses real polys defined via Library/poly.html
with polys constrained to have integer coefficients.

Historical notes:

Various sources attribute the last theorem to 1885 Weierstrass
as the "Lindemann--Weierstrass theorem",
or sometimes the "Hermite--Lindemann--Weierstrass theorem".
My reading of the Lindemann and Weierstrass papers is that
Lindemann had this theorem and Weierstrass was, with Lindemann's agreement,
just giving a more detailed exposition of the result,
not assuming so much reader familiarity with 1873 Hermite.

Baker's book refers to the second result as "Lindemann's theorem",
saying that Lindemann sketched the proof
and that Weierstrass gave a rigorous proof.
I don't know what's supposedly missing from the sketch.

Some sources instead claim that this theorem is a simplification due to Baker
of the original "Lindemann--Weierstrass theorem",
namely the statement that if α_1,... are algebraic numbers
linearly independent over \Q
then exp(α_1),... are algebraically independent over \Q.
No evident signs of anyone asking the obvious questions:
"Um, are we sure that people didn't find this theorem first,
with the algebraic-independence version as a corollary later?
Maybe we should check what Lindemann actually wrote?"

Proof notes:

The high-level structure of the proofs here
follows Lindemann and most of the literature
in symmetrizing β to reduce to the case that β_α is rational,
and symmetrizing α to reduce further to the core case that
β_α is rational and invariant under conjugation of α.

The first major proof stage is the core proof,
producing transcendence_all_0_QinC here:
if sum_α β_α exp α = 0,
where each α is algebraic, each β_α is rational,
and β_α is invariant under conjugation of α,
then each β_α = 0.

The core proof here follows 1990 Beukers--Bezivin--Robba.
Most of the literature instead follows 1893 Hilbert.

The core proof here uses polynomial reversals.
Laurent series would avoid this but would need more infrastructure.

For eventually optimizing an explicit form of the transcendence proof
(proving a lower bound on weighted sum of exp of algebraic numbers),
one wants an explicit lower bound on factorials,
such as factorial_lower_bound here (which says (n/e)^n <= n!).
More work (as in, e.g., 100/stirling.ml)
produces only marginally better bounds.

For the current target of just saying sum of exp of algebraic is nonzero,
it suffices to say that factorials eventually beat any exponential.
This doesn't need the explicit bound, but isn't much simpler,
so the proof here uses the explicit bound.

The proofs of transcendence of e and pi here
are immediately after the first stage.
This is common in the literature:
it is a warmup for parts of the second stage,
and it gives proofs of those facts that are shorter overall
than deriving the facts after the second stage (or the third).

The pi proof here uses explicit resolvent identities,
proven via expformal and Newton's identities,
whereas all of the literature that I've found
instead uses the fundamental theorem of symmetric functions.

(Some sources credit Newton's identities to Girard.
I don't see the rationale for this credit.
1629 Girard had _formulas_ for first few coeffs in terms of power sums.
1707 Newton had a bilinear identity relating coeffs to power sums,
which can be used as a _recurrence_ for all coeffs given power sums.
One way to prove Girard's formulas is to iterate Newton's identities;
this doesn't mean that Girard published Newton's identities.)

The second major proof stage uses α symmetrization
to obtain zero_sum_QinC_exp_algebraic here:
if sum_α β_α exp α = 0,
where each α is algebraic and each β_α is rational,
then each β_α = 0.

Consider the product prod_q (sum_α β_α exp(q(α)))
where q runs through all permutations
of a finite Galois-stable set containing all α.
This product is 0: consider the identity permutation.
Expanding the product produces
a sum that fits the core case.
As in the literature, the proof here
uses the fundamental theorem of symmetric functions
(which is also proven here).
Applying the core theorem then shows that
sum_D ((prod β_α^(D_α)) #{f: sum_q q(f(q)) = z}) = 0
for each z, where f runs through functions with distribution D.
There is then a denouement concluding that β_α = 0 for each α.

The typical denouement in the literature
identifies the maximum z with nonzero prod β_α^(D_α),
where maximum refers to lex order on \C.
A different denouement appears in
1952 Steinberg--Redheffer "Analytic proof of the Lindemann theorem".
The denouement here follows 1952 Steinberg--Redheffer
but works with expformal to skip a detour through convergence.
The point is that, working backwards, one has
prod_q (sum_α β_α E(q(α))) = 0
and thus sum_α β_α E(q(α)) = 0 for some q,
for any function E mapping addition to multiplication in some field.
The 1952 proof considers E(α) = z^α for various complex z;
the proof here takes E = expformal.

The third major proof stage symmetrizes β,
producing zero_sum_algebraic_exp_algebraic here:
if sum_α β_α exp α = 0,
where each α is algebraic and each β_α is algebraic,
then each β_α = 0.

For β symmetrization, analogously to α symmetrization,
the proof here follows the literature
in using the fundamental theorem of symmetric functions,
but again uses a simplified version of the 1952 denouement.

As in, e.g., 2017 Bernard, the β symmetrization here
works with one polynomial having all β as roots,
rather than separately symmetrizing each β.
The shortest-for-papers symmetrization approach
(used in, e.g., 1990 Beukers--Bezivin--Robba)
picks a finite-degree Galois extension of \Q containing all α and all β
and then applies all automorphisms of the extension
to symmetrize all α and β simultaneously,
but this relies on more background.

The proof here of transcendental_if_exp_nonzero_algebraic
is immediately after the second stage.
This is common in the literature.
Waiting until after the third stage
would replace the minpoly over \Q in this proof
with a linear poly over \Qbar,
giving a slightly shorter last step of the proof
but again longer proofs overall.
Computationally, the β symmetrization,
if optimized, would give back the same minpoly over \Q.

Prerequisite notes:

The big import of Multivariate/cauchy.ml
is for the fundamental theorem of algebra (FTA).
This also brings in various complex-number basics,
the complex exponential function (cexp),
and a bound on the tail of the exp series (TAYLOR_CEXP).

Most proofs of Lindemann's theorem have bigger analytic parts,
for example to put bounds on integrals.
The proof here focuses more on identities of formal power series.

Another way to prove the following:
prove complex_root_powersums_ZinC_monic_irreducible_ZinC
(as in complex_root_powersums_ZinC_monic_irreducible_ZinC,
plus relating ZinC irreducibles to QinC irreducibles)
and then multiply each root by D to reduce to that case.

Alternatively, after proving this, can specialize to Z=1
to prove complex_root_powersums_ZinC_monic_irreducible_ZinC.

Yet another way,
after showing that algebraic integers form a ring:
Dz is an algebraic integer for each z
so sum_z (Dz)^n is an algebraic integer
but D^n sum_z z^n is rational, ergo integer.
This again boils down to Newton's identities.
