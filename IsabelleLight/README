### BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS AND TACTICS:
(refer to the comments in the files for more information)

GEN_ALL_TAC           : Eliminates all universal quantifiers.

REWRITE_ASM_TAC thl   : Rewrites assumptions. PURE_, ONCE_ and PURE_ONCE_
                        versions also available.
FULL_REWRITE_TAC thl  : Rewrites assumptions then goal.
FULL_SIMP_TAC thl     : SIMP_TAC then FULL_REWRITE_TAC.

X_MATCH_GEN_TAC tm    : X_GEN_TAC, X_CHOOSE_TAC, EXISTS_TAC with
X_MATCH_CHOOSE_TAC tm   type matching
MATCH_EXISTS_TAC tm

gen_case_tac          : Applies case_tac to leading universally quantified
                        variable in the goal.

induct_tac            : Induction with any inductive datatype.
