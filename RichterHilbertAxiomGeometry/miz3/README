HilbertAxiom.ml is a formalization using miz3 of the plane geometry
part of the Hilbert axiomatic geometry paper
http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf

Miz3Tips gives details on running HilbertAxiom.ml, and some
information on how to use miz3.

FontHilbertAxiom.ml is a version of HilbertAxiom.ml written with
mathematical characters
⇒, ⇔, ¬, ∨, ∧, ∀, ∃, ⊂, ∈, ∪, ∩ and ∅
which HOL4, Isabelle and readable.ml allow.  It requires

hol-light-fonts.el is needed to run the miz3 code FontHilbertAxiom.ml.
hol-light-fonts.elc is the byte-compiled version of the Emacs code.

make.ml is an easy way to run the miz3 code HilbertAxiom.ml:
#use "RichterHilbertAxiomGeometry/miz3/make.ml";;
