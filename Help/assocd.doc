\TYPE {assocd : 'a -> ('a * 'b) list -> 'b -> 'b}

\SYNOPSIS
Looks up item in association list taking default in case of failure.

\DESCRIBE
The call {assocd x [x1,y1; ...; xn,yn] y} returns the first {yi} in the list
where the corresponding {xi} is the same as {x}. If there is no such item, it
returns the value {y}. This is similar to {assoc} except that the latter will
fail rather than take a default.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # assocd 2 [1,2; 2,4; 3,6] (-1);;
  val it : int = 4
  # assocd 4 [1,2; 2,4; 3,6] (-1);;
  val it : int = -1
}

\USES
Simple lookup without exception handling.
