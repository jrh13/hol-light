\DOC ss_of_prover

\TYPE {ss_of_prover : (strategy -> strategy) -> simpset -> simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
Change the method of prover application in a simpset.

\DESCRIBE
In their maximal generality, simplification operations in HOL Light (as invoked
by {SIMP_TAC}) are controlled by a `simpset', which may contain conditional and
unconditional rewrite rules, conversions and provers for conditions, as well as
a determination of how to use the prover on the conditions and how to process
theorems into rewrites. The default `prover use' method is to first recursively
apply all the simplification to conditions and then try the provers, if any,
one by one until one succeeds. It is unusual to want to change this, but if
desired you can do it with {ss_of_prover str ss}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
