\TYPE {meson_prefine : bool ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes {MESON} apply Plaisted's positive refinement.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of several parameters determining the behavior of {MESON},
{MESON_TAC} and related rules and tactics. When the flag {meson_prefine} is
{true}, as it is by default, Plaisted's ``positive refinement'' is used in
proof search; this limits the search space at the cost of sometimes requiring
longer proofs. When {meson_prefine} is false, this refinement is not applied.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\USES
For users requiring fine control over the algorithms used in {MESON}'s
first-order proof search.

\COMMENTS
For more details, see Plaisted's article ``A Sequent-Style Model Elimination
Strategy and a Positive Refinement'', Journal of Automated Reasoning volume 6,
1990.
