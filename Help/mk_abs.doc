\DOC mk_abs

\TYPE {mk_abs : term * term -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
Constructs an abstraction.

\DESCRIBE
If {v} is a variable and {t} any term, then {mk_abs(v,t)} produces the
abstraction term {\v. t}. It is not necessary that {v} should occur free in
{t}.

\FAILURE
Fails if {v} is not a variable. See {mk_gabs} for constructing generalized
abstraction terms.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # mk_abs(`x:num`,`x + 1`);;
  val it : term = `\x. x + 1`
}

\SEEALSO
