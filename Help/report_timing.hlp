\DOC report_timing

\TYPE {report_timing : bool ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Flag to determine whether {time} function outputs CPU time measure.

\DESCRIBE
When {report_timing} is true, a call {time f x} will evaluate {f x} as usual
but also as a side-effect print out the CPU time taken. If {report_timing} is
false, nothing will be printed. Times are already printed in this way
automatically as informative output in some rules like {MESON}, so this can be
used to silence them.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # time NUM_REDUCE_CONV `2 EXP 300 < 2 EXP 200`;;
  CPU time (user): 0.13
  val it : thm = |- 2 EXP 300 < 2 EXP 200 <=> F
  # report_timing := false;;
  val it : unit = ()
  # time NUM_REDUCE_CONV `2 EXP 300 < 2 EXP 200`;;
  val it : thm = |- 2 EXP 300 < 2 EXP 200 <=> F
}
