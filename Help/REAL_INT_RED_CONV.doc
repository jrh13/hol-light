\DOC REAL_INT_RED_CONV

\TYPE {REAL_INT_RED_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs one arithmetic or relational operation on integer literals of type
{:real}.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to any of the terms {`--c`}, {`abs c`}, {`c1 + c2`}, {`c1 - c2`},
{`c1 * c2`}, {`c pow n`}, {`c1 <= c2`}, {`c1 < c2`}, {`c1 >= c2`}, {`c1 > c2`},
{`c1 = c2`}, where {c}, {c1} and {c2} are integer literals of type {:real} and
{n} is a numeral of type {:num}, {REAL_INT_RED_CONV} returns a theorem
asserting the equivalence of the term to a canonical integer (for the
arithmetic operators) or a truth-value (for the relational operators). The
integer literals are terms of the form {&n} or {-- &n} (with nonzero {n} in the
latter case).

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to an inappropriate term.

\USES
More convenient for most purposes is {REAL_INT_REDUCE_CONV}, which applies
these evaluation conversions recursively at depth, or still more generally
{REAL_RAT_REDUCE_CONV} which applies to any rational numbers, not just
integers. Still, access to this `one-step' reduction can be handy if you want to
add a conversion {conv} for some other operator on real number literals, which
you can conveniently incorporate it into {REAL_INT_REDUCE_CONV} with
{
  # let REAL_INT_REDUCE_CONV' =
      DEPTH_CONV(REAL_INT_RED_CONV ORELSEC conv);;
}
