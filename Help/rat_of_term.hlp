\DOC rat_of_term

\TYPE {rat_of_term : term -> num}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a canonical rational literal of type {:real} to an OCaml number.

\DESCRIBE
The call {rat_of_term t} where term {t} is a canonical rational literal of type
{:real} returns the corresponding OCaml rational number (type {num}). The
canonical literals are integer literals {&n} for numeral {n}, {-- &n} for a
nonzero numeral {n}, or ratios {&p / &q} or {-- &p / &q} where {p} is nonzero,
{q > 1} and {p} and {q} share no common factor.

\FAILURE
Fails when applied to a term that is not a canonical rational literal.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # rat_of_term `-- &22 / &7`;;
  val it : num = -22/7
}
