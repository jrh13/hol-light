\TYPE {lookup : term -> 'a net -> 'a list}

\SYNOPSIS
Look up term in a term net.

\DESCRIBE
Term nets (type {'a net}) are a lookup structure associating objects of type
{'a}, e.g. conversions, with a corresponding `pattern' term. For a given term,
one can then relatively quickly look up all objects whose pattern terms might
possibly match to it. This is used, for example, in rewriting to quickly filter
out obviously inapplicable rewrites rather than attempting each one in turn.
The call {lookup t net} for a term {t} returns the list of objects whose
patterns might possibly be matchable to {t}. Note that this is conservative: if
the pattern could be matched (even higher-order matched) in the sense of
{term_match}, it will be in the list, but it is possible that some
non-matchable objects will be returned. (For example, a pattern term {x + x}
will match any term of the form {a + b}, even if {a} and {b} are the same.) It
is intended that nets are a first-level filter for efficiency; finer
discrimination may be embodied in the subsequent action with the list of
returned objects.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
If we want to create ourselves the kind of automated rewriting with the basic
rewrites that is done by {REWRITE_CONV}, we could simply try in succession all
the rewrites:
{
  # let BASIC_REWRITE_CONV' = FIRST_CONV (map REWR_CONV (basic_rewrites()));;
  val ( BASIC_REWRITE_CONV' ) : conv = <fun>
}
However, it would be more efficient to use the left-hand sides as patterns
in a term net to organize the different rewriting conversions:
{
  # let rewr_net =
      let enter_thm th = enter (freesl(hyp th)) (lhs(concl th),REWR_CONV th) in
      itlist enter_thm (basic_rewrites()) empty_net;;
}
Now given a term, we get only the items with matchable patterns, usually much
less than the full list:
{
  # lookup `(\x. x + 1) 2` rewr_net;;
  val it : (term -> thm) list = [<fun>]

  # lookup `T /\ T` rewr_net;;
  val it : (term -> thm) list = [<fun>; <fun>; <fun>]
}
The three items returned in the last call are rewrites based on the theorems
{|- T /\ t <=> t}, {|- t /\ T <=> t} and {|- t /\ t <=> t}, which are the only
ones matchable. We can use this net for a more efficient version of the same
conversion:
{
  # let BASIC_REWRITE_CONV tm = FIRST_CONV (lookup tm rewr_net) tm;;
  val ( BASIC_REWRITE_CONV ) : term -> conv = <fun>
}
To see that it is indeed more efficient, consider:
{
  # let tm = funpow 8 (fun x -> mk_conj(x,x)) `T`;;
  ...
  time (DEPTH_CONV BASIC_REWRITE_CONV) tm;;
  CPU time (user): 0.08
  ...
  time (DEPTH_CONV BASIC_REWRITE_CONV') tm;;
  CPU time (user): 1.121
  ...
}
