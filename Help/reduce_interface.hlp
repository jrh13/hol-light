\TYPE {reduce_interface : string * term -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Remove a specific overload/interface mapping for an identifier.

\DESCRIBE

{override_interface}) or be overloaded to several depending on type (see
{overload_interface}). A call to {remove_interface "ident"} removes all such
mappings for the identifier {ident}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, whether or not there were any interface mappings in effect.

\SEEALSO
