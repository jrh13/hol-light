\DOC INT_REM_DOWN_CONV

\TYPE {INT_REM_DOWN_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Combines nested {rem} terms into a single toplevel one.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term containing integer arithmetic operations of
negation, addition, subtraction, multiplication and exponentiation,
interspersed with applying {rem} with a fixed modulus {n}, and a toplevel
{... rem n} too, the conversion {INT_REM_DOWN_CONV} proves that this is equal
to a simplified term with only the toplevel {rem}.

\FAILURE
Never fails but may have no effect

\EXAMPLE
{
  # let tm = `((x rem n) + (y rem n * &3) pow 2) rem n`;;
  val tm : term = `(x rem n + (y rem n * &3) pow 2) rem n`

  # INT_REM_DOWN_CONV tm;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (x rem n + (y rem n * &3) pow 2) rem n = (x + (y * &3) pow 2) rem n
}
