\TYPE {extend_basic_congs : thm list -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Extends the set of congruence rules used by the simplifier.

\DESCRIBE
The HOL Light simplifier (as invoked by {SIMP_TAC} etc.) uses congruence rules
to determine how it uses context when descending through a term. These are
essentially theorems showing how to decompose one equality to a series of other
inequalities in context. A call to {extend_basic_congs thl} adds the congruence
rules in {thl} to the defaults.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
By default, the simplifier uses context {p} when simplifying {q} within an
implication {p ==> q}. Some users would like the simplifier to do likewise for
a conjunction {p /\ q}, which is not done by default:
{
  # SIMP_CONV[] `x = 1 /\ x < 2`;;
  val it : thm = |- x = 1 /\ x < 2 <=> x = 1 /\ x < 2
}
\noindent You can make it do so with
{
  # extend_basic_congs
     [TAUT `(p <=> p') ==> (p' ==> (q <=> q')) ==> (p /\ q <=> p' /\ q')`];;
  val it : unit = ()
}
\noindent as you can see:
{
  # SIMP_CONV[] `x = 1 /\ x < 2`;;
  val it : thm = |- x = 1 /\ x < 2 <=> x = 1 /\ 1 < 2

  # SIMP_CONV[ARITH] `x = 1 /\ x < 2`;;
  val it : thm = |- x = 1 /\ x < 2 <=> x = 1
}
