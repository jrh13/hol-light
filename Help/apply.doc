\TYPE {apply : ('a, 'b) func -> 'a -> 'b}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a finite partial function, failing on undefined points.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of a suite of operations on finite partial functions, type
{('a,'b)func}. These may sometimes be preferable to ordinary functions since
they permit more operations such as equality comparison, extraction of domain
etc. If {f} is a finite partial function and {x} an argument, {apply f x} tries
to apply {f} to {x} and fails if it is undefined.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # apply undefined 1;;
  Exception: Failure "apply".
  # apply (1 |=> 2) 1;;
  val it : int = 2
}
