\DOC TAUT

\TYPE {TAUT : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves a propositional tautology.

\DESCRIBE
The call {TAUT `t`} where {t} is a propositional tautology, will prove it
automatically and return {|- t}. A propositional tautology is
a formula built up using the logical connectives `{~}', `{/\}', `{\/}', `{==>}'
and `{<=>}' from terms that can be considered ``atomic'' that is logically
valid whatever truth-values are assigned to the atomic formulas.

\FAILURE
Fails if {t} is not a propositional tautology.

\EXAMPLE
Here is a simple and potentially useful tautology:
{
  # TAUT `a \/ b ==> c <=> (a ==> c) /\ (b ==> c)`;;
  val it : thm = |- a \/ b ==> c <=> (a ==> c) /\ (b ==> c)
}
\noindent and here is a more surprising one:
{
  # TAUT `(p ==> q) \/ (q ==> p)`;;
  val it : thm = |- (p ==> q) \/ (q ==> p)
}
\noindent Note that the ``atomic'' formulas need not just be variables:
{
  # TAUT `(x > 2 ==> y > 3) \/ (y < 3 ==> x > 2)`;;
  val it : thm = |- (x > 2 ==> y > 3) \/ (y < 3 ==> x > 2)
}

\USES
Solving a tautologous goal completely by {CONV_TAC TAUT}, or generating a
tautology to massage the goal into a more convenient equivalent form by
{REWRITE_TAC[TAUT `...`]} or {ONCE_REWRITE_TAC[TAUT `...`]}.

\COMMENTS
The algorithm used is quite naive, and not efficient on large formulas. For
more general first-order reasoning, with quantifier instantiation, use
MESON-based methods.
