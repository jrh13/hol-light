\DOC NUM_TO_INT_CONV

\TYPE {NUM_TO_INT_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Maps an assertion over natural numbers to equivalent over reals.

\DESCRIBE
Given a term, with arbitrary quantifier alternations over the natural numbers,
{NUM_TO_INT_CONV} proves its equivalence to a term involving integer operations
and quantifiers. Some preprocessing removes certain natural-specific operations
such as {PRE} and cutoff subtraction, quantifiers are systematically
relativized to the set of positive integers.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # NUM_TO_INT_CONV `n - m <= n`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- n - m <= n <=>
       (!i. ~(&0 <= i) \/
            (~(&m = &n + i) \/ &0 <= &n) /\ (~(&n = &m + i) \/ i <= &n))
}

\USES
Mostly intended as a preprocessing step to allow rules for the integers to
deduce facts about natural numbers too.
