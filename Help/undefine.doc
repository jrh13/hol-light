\TYPE {undefine : 'a -> ('a, 'b) func -> ('a, 'b) func}

\SYNOPSIS
Remove definition of a finite partial function on specific domain value.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of a suite of operations on finite partial functions, type
{('a,'b)func}. These may sometimes be preferable to ordinary functions since
they permit more operations such as equality comparison, extraction of domain
etc. The call {undefine x f} removes a definition for the domain value {x} in
the finite partial function {f}; if there was none to begin with the function
is unchanged.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # let f = itlist I [1 |-> "1"; 2 |-> "2"; 3 |-> "3"] undefined;;
  val f : (int, string) func = <func>
  # dom f;;
  val it : int list = [1; 2; 3]
  # dom(undefine 2 f);;
  val it : int list = [1; 3]
}
