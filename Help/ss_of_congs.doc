\TYPE {ss_of_congs : thm list -> simpset -> simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
Add congruence rules to a simpset.

\DESCRIBE
In their maximal generality, simplification operations in HOL Light (as invoked
by {SIMP_TAC}) are controlled by a `simpset', which may contain conditional and
unconditional rewrite rules, conversions and provers for conditions, as well as
a determination of how to use the prover on the conditions and how to process
theorems into rewrites. A call {ss_of_congs thl ss} adds {thl} as new
congruence rules to the simpset {ss} to yield a new simpset. For an
illustration of how congruence rules can be used, see {extend_basic_congs}.

\FAILURE
Never fails unless the congruence rules are malformed.
