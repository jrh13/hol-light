\DOC overload_interface

\TYPE {overload_interface : string * term -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Overload a symbol so it may denote a particular underlying constant.

\DESCRIBE
HOL Light allows the same identifier to denote several different underlying
constants. A call to {overload_interface("ident",`cname`)}, where {cname} is
either a constant to be denoted or a variable with the same name and type (if
the constant is not yet defined) will include {cname} as one of the possible
overload resolutions of the symbol {ident}. Moreover, when the resolution is
not possible from type information, {cname} will now be the default. However,
before any calls to {overload_interface}, the constant must have been declared
overloadable with {make_overloadable}, and the term {`cname`} must have a type
that is an instance of the most general ``type skeleton'' specified there.

\FAILURE
Fails if the identifier has not been declared overloadable, if the term is not
a constant or variable, or it its type is not an instance of the declared type
skeleton.

\EXAMPLE
The symbol `{+}' has an overload skeleton of type {`:A->A->A`}. Here we
overload it on type {:bool} to denote logical `or'. (This is just for
illustration; it's strongly recommended that you don't do this, since you will
typically need to add more type annotations in terms to compensate for the
ambiguity.)
{
  # overload_interface("+",`(\/)`);;
  val it : unit = ()
}
\noindent Now we can use the symbol `{+}' with multiple meanings in the same
terms; the underlying constants are still the original ones, though:
{
  # `(x = 1) + (1 + 1 = 2)`;;
  val it : term = `(x = 1) + (1 + 1 = 2)`
}
You can also overload polymorphic symbols, e.g. overload `{+}' so that it maps
to list append:
{
  # overload_interface("+",`APPEND`);;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val it : unit = ()

  # APPEND;;
  val it : thm = |- (!l. [] + l = l) /\ (!h t l. CONS h t + l = CONS h (t + l))
}
