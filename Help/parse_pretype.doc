\TYPE {parse_pretype : lexcode list -> pretype * lexcode list}

\SYNOPSIS
Parses a pretype.

\DESCRIBE
The call {parse_pretype t}, where {t} is a list of lexical tokens (as produced
by {lex}), parses the tokens and returns a pretype as well as the unparsed
tokens.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is a syntax error in the token list.

\USES
This is mostly an internal function; pretypes and preterms are used as an
intermediate representation for typechecking and overload resolution and are
not normally of concern to users.

\SEEALSO
lex, parse_preterm, parse_term, parse_type.
