\TYPE {prove_recursive_functions_exist : thm -> term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Prove existence of recursive function over inductive type.

\DESCRIBE
This function has essentially the same interface and functionality as
{new_recursive_definition}, but it merely proves the existence of the function
rather than defining it.

The first argument to {prove_recursive_functions_exist} is the primitive
recursion theorem for the concrete type in question; this is normally the
second theorem obtained from {define_type}. The second argument is a term
giving the desired primitive recursive function definition. The value returned
by {prove_recursive_functions_exist} is a theorem stating the existence of a
function satisfying the `definition' clauses. This theorem is derived by formal
proof from an instance of the general primitive recursion theorem given as the
second argument.

Let {C1}, ..., {Cn} be the constructors of this type, and let `{(Ci vs)}'
represent a (curried) application of the {i}th constructor to a sequence of
variables.  Then a curried primitive recursive function {fn} over {ty} can be
specified by a conjunction of (optionally universally-quantified) clauses of
the form:
{
   fn v1 ... (C1 vs1) ... vm  =  body1   /\
   fn v1 ... (C2 vs2) ... vm  =  body2   /\
                             .
                             .
   fn v1 ... (Cn vsn) ... vm  =  bodyn
}
\noindent where the variables {v1}, ..., {vm}, {vs} are distinct in each
clause, and where in the {i}th clause {fn} appears (free) in {bodyi} only
as part of an application of the form:
{
   `fn t1 ... v ... tm`
}
\noindent in which the variable {v} of type {ty} also occurs among the
variables {vsi}.

If {<definition>} is a conjunction of clauses, as described above, then
evaluating:
{
   prove_recursive_functions_exist th `<definition>`;;
}
\noindent automatically proves the existence of a function {fn} that satisfies
the defining equations supplied, and returns a theorem:
{
  |- ?fn. <definition>
}
{prove_recursive_functions_exist} also allows the supplied definition to omit
clauses for any number of constructors.  If a defining equation for the {i}th
constructor is omitted, then the value of {fn} at that constructor:
{
   fn v1 ... (Ci vsi) ... vn
}
\noindent is left unspecified ({fn}, however, is still a total function).

\FAILURE
Fails if the clauses cannot be matched up with the recursion theorem. You may
find that {prove_general_recursive_function_exists} still works in such cases.

\EXAMPLE
Here we show that there exists a product function:
{
  prove_recursive_functions_exist num_RECURSION
   `(prod f 0 = 1) /\ (!n. prod f (SUC n) = f(SUC n) * prod f n)`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- ?prod. prod f 0 = 1 /\ (!n. prod f (SUC n) = f (SUC n) * prod f n)
}

\COMMENTS
Often {prove_general_recursive_function_exists} is an easier route to the same
goal. Its interface is simpler (no need to specify the recursion theorem) and
it is more powerful. However, for suitably constrained definitions
{prove_recursive_functions_exist} works well and is much more efficient.

\USES
It is more usual to want to actually make definitions of recursive functions.
However, if a recursive function is needed in the middle of a proof, and seems
to ad-hoc for general use, you may just use {prove_recursive_functions_exist},
perhaps adding the ``definition'' as an assumption of the goal with
{CHOOSE_TAC}.
