\DOC mk_rewrites

\TYPE {mk_rewrites : bool -> thm -> thm list -> thm list}

\SYNOPSIS
Turn theorem into list of (conditional) rewrites.

\DESCRIBE
Given a Boolean flag {b}, a theorem {th} and a list of theorems {thl}, the call
{mk_rewrites b th thl} breaks {th} down into a collection of rewrites (for
example, splitting conjunctions up into several sub-theorems) and appends them
to the front of {thl} (which are normally theorems already processed in this
way). Non-equational theorems {|- p} are converted to {|- p <=> T}. If the flag
{b} is true, then implicational theorems {|- p ==> s = t} are used as
conditional rewrites; otherwise they are converted to {|- (p ==> s = t) <=> T}.
This function is applied inside {extend_basic_rewrites} and
{set_basic_rewrites}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # ADD_CLAUSES;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (!n. 0 + n = n) /\
       (!m. m + 0 = m) /\
       (!m n. SUC m + n = SUC (m + n)) /\
       (!m n. m + SUC n = SUC (m + n))

  # mk_rewrites false ADD_CLAUSES [];;
  val it : thm list =
    [|- 0 + n = n; |- m + 0 = m; |- SUC m + n = SUC (m + n);
     |- m + SUC n = SUC (m + n)]
}
