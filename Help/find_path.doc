\TYPE {find_path : (term -> bool) -> term -> string}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a path to some subterm satisfying a predicate.

\DESCRIBE
The call {find_path p t} traverses the term {t} top-down until it finds a
subterm satisfying the predicate {p}. It then returns a path indicating how to
reach it; this is just a string with each character interpreted as:

\begin{{itemize}}

\item {"b"}: take the body of an abstraction

\item {"l"}: take the left (rator) path in an application

\item {"r"}: take the right (rand) path in an application

\end{{itemize}}

\FAILURE
Fails if there is no subterm satisfying {p}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # find_path is_list `!x. ~(x = []) ==> CONS (HD x) (TL x) = x`;;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val it : string = "rblrrr"
}
