\DOC lcm_num

\TYPE {lcm_num : num -> num -> num}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes lowest common multiple of two unlimited-precision integers.

\DESCRIBE
The call {lcm_num m n} for two unlimited-precision (type {num}) integers {m} and
{n} returns the (positive) lowest common multiple of {m} and {n}. If either {m}
or {n} (or both) are both zero, it returns zero.

\FAILURE
Fails if either number is not an integer (the type {num} supports arbitrary
rationals).

\EXAMPLE
{
  # lcm_num (Int 35) (Int(-77));;
  val it : num = 385
}
