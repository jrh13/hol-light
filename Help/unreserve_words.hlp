\DOC unreserve_words

\TYPE {unreserve_words : string list -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Remove given strings from the set of reserved words.

\DESCRIBE
Certain identifiers in HOL are reserved, e.g. `{if}', `{let}' and `{|}',
meaning that they are special to the parser and cannot be used as ordinary
identifiers. The call {unreserve_words l} removes all strings in {l} from the
list of reserved identifiers.

\FAILURE
Never fails, regardless of whether the given strings were in fact reserved.

\COMMENTS
The initial set of reserved words in HOL Light should be unreserved only with
great care, since then various elementary constructs may fail to parse.
