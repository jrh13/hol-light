\DOC HAS_SIZE_DIMINDEX_RULE

\TYPE {HAS_SIZE_DIMINDEX_RULE : hol_type -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes the {dimindex} for a standard finite type.

\DESCRIBE
Finite types parsed and printed as numerals are provided, and this conversion
when applied to such a type of the form {`:n`} returns the theorem
{|- (:n) HAS_SIZE n} where the {(:n)} is the customary HOL Light printing of
the universe set {UNIV:n->bool}, the second {n} is a numeral term and
{HAS_SIZE} is the usual cardinality relation.

\FAILURE
Fails if the type provided is not a standard finite type.

\EXAMPLE
Here we use a 64-element type, perhaps useful for indexing the bits of a
word:
{
  # HAS_SIZE_DIMINDEX_RULE `:64`;;
  val it : thm = |- (:64) HAS_SIZE 64
}
