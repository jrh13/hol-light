\DOC term_union

\TYPE {term_union : term list -> term list -> term list}

\SYNOPSIS
Union of two sets of terms up to alpha-equivalence.

\DESCRIBE
The call {term_union l1 l2} for two lists of terms {l1} and {l2} returns a list
including all of {l2} and all terms of {l1} for which no alpha-equivalent term
occurs in {l2} or earlier in {l1}. If both lists were sets modulo
alpha-conversion, i.e. contained no alpha-equivalent pairs, then so will be the
result.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # term_union [`1`; `2`] [`2`; `3`];;
  val it : term list = [`1`; `2`; `3`]

  # term_union [`!x. x >= 0`; `?u. u > 0`] [`?w. w > 0`; `!u. u >= 0`];;
  val it : term list = [`?w. w > 0`; `!u. u >= 0`]
}

\USES
For combining assumption lists of theorems without duplication of
alpha-equivalent ones.
