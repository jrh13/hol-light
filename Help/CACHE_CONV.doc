\DOC CACHE_CONV

\TYPE {CACHE_CONV : (term -> thm) -> term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Accelerates a conversion by cacheing previous results.

\DESCRIBE
If {cnv} is any conversion, then {CACHE_CONV cnv} gives a new conversion that
is functionally identical but keeps a cache of previous arguments and results,
and simply returns the cached result if the same input is encountered again.

\FAILURE
Never fails, though the subsequent application to a term may.

\EXAMPLE
The following call takes a while, making several applications to the same
expression:
{
  # time (DEPTH_CONV NUM_RED_CONV) `31 EXP 31 + 31 EXP 31 + 31 EXP 31`;;
  CPU time (user): 1.542
  val it : thm =
    |- 31 EXP 31 + 31 EXP 31 + 31 EXP 31 =
       51207522392169707875831929087177944268134203293
}
\noindent whereas the cached variant is faster since the result for {31 EXP 31}
is stored away and re-used after the first call:
{
  # time (DEPTH_CONV(CACHE_CONV NUM_RED_CONV))
         `31 EXP 31 + 31 EXP 31 + 31 EXP 31`;;
  CPU time (user): 0.461
  val it : thm =
    |- 31 EXP 31 + 31 EXP 31 + 31 EXP 31 =
       51207522392169707875831929087177944268134203293
}
