\TYPE {CHOOSE : term * thm -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates existential quantification using deduction from a
particular witness.

\KEYWORDS
rule, existential.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term-theorem pair {(v,A1 |- ?x. s)} and a second
theorem of the form {A2 |- t}, the inference rule {CHOOSE}
produces the theorem {A1 u (A2 - {{s[v/x]}}) |- t}.
{
    A1 |- ?x. s[x]    A2 |- t
   -------------------------------  CHOOSE (`v`,(A1 |- ?x. s))
     A1 u (A2 - {{s[v/x]}}) |- t
}
\noindent Where {v} is not free in {A2 - {{s[v/x]}}}, {s} or {t}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the terms and theorems correspond as indicated above; in
particular, {v} must be a variable and have the same type as the variable
existentially quantified over, and it must not be free in {A2 - {{s[v/x]}}},
{s} or {t}.

\COMMENTS
For the special case of simply existentially quantifying an assumption over a
variable, {SIMPLE_CHOOSE} is easier.
