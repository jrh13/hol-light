\TYPE {VALID : tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Tries to ensure that a tactic is valid.

\KEYWORDS
tactical.

\DESCRIBE
For any tactic {t}, the application {VALID t} gives a new tactic that does
exactly the same as {t} except that it also checks validity of the tactic
and will fail if it is violated. Validity means that the subgoals produced by
{t} can, if proved, be used by the justification function given by {t} to
construct a theorem corresponding to the original goal.

This check is performed by actually creating, using {mk_fthm}, theorems
corresponding to the subgoals, and seeing if the result of applying the
justification function to them gives a theorem corresponding to the original
goal. If it does, then {VALID t} simply applies {t}, and if not it fails. In
principle, the extra dummy hypothesis used by {mk_fthm} (necessary to ensure
logical soundness) could interfere with the mechanism of the tactic, but this
never seems to happen.

\COMMENTS
You can always force validity checking whenever it is applied by using {VALID}
on a tactic. But if the goal is initially proved by using the subgoal stack
this is probably not necessary since {VALID} is already implicitly applied in
the {e} (expand) function.
