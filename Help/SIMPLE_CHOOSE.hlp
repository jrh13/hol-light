\DOC SIMPLE_CHOOSE

\TYPE {SIMPLE_CHOOSE : term -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Existentially quantifies a hypothesis of a theorem.

\DESCRIBE
A call {SIMPLE_CHOOSE `v` th} existentially quantifies a hypothesis of the
theorem over the variable {v}. It is intended for use when there is only one
hypothesis so that the choice of assumption is unambiguous. In general, it
picks the one that happens to be first in the list.

\FAILURE
Fails if {v} is not a variable or if it is free in the conclusion of the
theorem {th}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # let th = SYM(ASSUME `x:num = y`);;
  val th : thm = x = y |- y = x
  # SIMPLE_EXISTS `x:num` th;;
  val it : thm = x = y |- ?x. y = x

  # SIMPLE_CHOOSE `x:num` it;;
  val it : thm = ?x. x = y |- ?x. y = x
}

\COMMENTS
The more general function is {CHOOSE}, but this is simpler in the special case.
