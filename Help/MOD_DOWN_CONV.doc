\DOC MOD_DOWN_CONV

\TYPE {MOD_DOWN_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Combines nested {MOD} terms into a single toplevel one.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term containing natural number arithmetic operations of
successor, addition, multiplication and exponentiation, interspersed with
applying {MOD} with a fixed modulus {n}, and a toplevel {... MOD n} too, the
conversion {MOD_DOWN_CONV} proves that this is equal to a simplified term with
only the toplevel {MOD}.

\FAILURE
Never fails but may have no effect

\EXAMPLE
{
  # let tm = `((x MOD n) + (y MOD n * 3) EXP 2) MOD n`;;
  val tm : term = `(x MOD n + (y MOD n * 3) EXP 2) MOD n`

  # MOD_DOWN_CONV tm;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (x MOD n + (y MOD n * 3) EXP 2) MOD n = (x + (y * 3) EXP 2) MOD n
}
