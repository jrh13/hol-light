\DOC INSTANTIATE_ALL

\TYPE {INSTANTIATE_ALL : instantiation -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Apply a higher-order instantiation to assumptions and conclusion of a theorem.

\DESCRIBE
The call {INSTANTIATE_ALL i t}, where {i} is an instantiation as returned by
{term_match}, will perform the instantiation indicated by {i} in the conclusion
of the theorem {th}: types and terms will be instantiated and the
beta-reductions that are part of higher-order matching will be applied.

\FAILURE
Never fails on a valid instantiation.

\COMMENTS
This is not intended for general use. {PART_MATCH} is generally a more
convenient packaging. The function {INSTANTIATE} is almost the same but does
not instantiate hypotheses and may fail if type variables or term variables
free in the hypotheses make the instantiation impossible.
