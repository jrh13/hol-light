\DOC dest_binder

\TYPE {dest_binder : string -> term -> term * term}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks apart a ``binder''.

\DESCRIBE
Applied to a term {tm} of the form {`c (\x. t)`} where {c} is a constant whose
name is {"s"}, the call {dest_binder "c" tm} returns {(`x`,`t`)}. Note that
this is actually independent of whether the name parses as a binder, but the
usual application is where it does.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term is not of the appropriate form with a constant of the same
name.

\EXAMPLE
The call {dest_binder "!"} is the same as {dest_forall}, and is in fact how
that function is implemented.
