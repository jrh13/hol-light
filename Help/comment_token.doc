\DOC comment_token

\TYPE {comment_token : lexcode ref}

\SYNOPSIS
HOL Light comment token.

\DESCRIBE
Users may insert comments in HOL Light terms that are ignored in parsing.
Comments are introduced by a special comment token and terminated by the next
end of line. (There are no multi-line comments supported in HOL Light terms.)
The reference {comment_token} stores the token that introduces a comment, which
by default is {Resword "//"} as in BCPL, C++, Java etc. The user may change it
to another token, though this should be done with care in case other proofs
break.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\EXAMPLE
Here we change the comment token to be `{--}' (as used in Ada, Eiffel, Haskell,
Occam and several other programming languages):
{
  # comment_token := Ident "--";;
  val it : unit = ()
}
\noindent and we can test that it works:
{
  # `let wordsize = 32 -- may change to 64 later
     and radix = 2     -- only care about binary
     in radix EXP wordsize`;;
  val it : term = `let wordsize = 32 and radix = 2 in radix EXP wordsize`
}

\COMMENTS
Comments are handled at the level of the lexical analyzer, so can also be used
in types and the strings used for the specification of inductive types.
