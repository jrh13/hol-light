\DOC ORDERED_REWR_CONV

\TYPE {ORDERED_REWR_CONV : (term -> term -> bool) -> thm -> term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Basic rewriting conversion restricted by term order.

\DESCRIBE
Given an ordering relation {ord}, an equational theorem {A |- !x1...xn. s = t}
that expresses a rewrite rule, the conversion {ORDERED_REWR_CONV} gives a
conversion that applied to any term {s'} will attempt to match the left-hand
side of the equation {s = t} to {s'}, and return the corresponding theorem {A
|- s' = t'}, but only if {ord `s'` `t'`}, i.e. if the left-hand side is
``greater'' in the ordering than the right-hand side, after instantiation. If
the ordering condition is violated, it will fail, even if the match is fine.

\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not of the right form or the two terms cannot be
matched, for example because the variables that need to be instantiated are
free in the hypotheses {A}, or if the ordering requirement fails.

\EXAMPLE
We apply the permutative rewrite:
{
  # ADD_SYM;;
  val it : thm = |- !m n. m + n = n + m
}
\noindent with the default term ordering {term_order} designed for this kind of
application. Note that it applies in one direction:
{
  # ORDERED_REWR_CONV term_order ADD_SYM `1 + 2`;;
  val it : thm = |- 1 + 2 = 2 + 1
}
\noindent but not the other:
{
  # ORDERED_REWR_CONV term_order ADD_SYM `2 + 1`;;
  Exception: Failure "ORDERED_REWR_CONV: wrong orientation".
}

\USES
Applying conditional rewrite rules that are permutative and would loop without
some restriction. Thanks to the fact that higher-level rewriting operations
like {REWRITE_CONV} and {REWRITE_TAC} have ordering built in for permutative
rewrite rules, rewriting with theorem like {ADD_AC} will effectively normalize
terms.
