\DOC set_basic_rewrites

\TYPE {set_basic_rewrites : thm list -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Assign the set of default rewrites used by rewriting and simplification.

\DESCRIBE
The HOL Light rewriter ({REWRITE_TAC} etc.) and simplifier ({SIMP_TAC} etc.)
have default sets of (conditional) equations and other conversions that are
applied by default, except in the {PURE_} variants. A call to
{extend_basic_rewrites thl} sets this to be the list of theorems {thl} (after
processing into rewrite rules by {mk_rewrites}).

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
Users will most likely want to extend the existing set by
{extend_basic_rewrites} rather than completely change it like this.

\SEEALSO
basic_rewrites, extend_basic_convs, set_basic_convs.
