\DOC REAL_POLY_POW_CONV

\TYPE {REAL_POLY_POW_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Raise real polynomial to numeral power while retaining canonical form.

\DESCRIBE
For many purposes it is useful to retain polynomials in a canonical form. For
more information on the usual normal form in HOL Light, see the function
{REAL_POLY_CONV}, which converts a polynomial to normal form while proving the
equivalence of the original and normalized forms. The function
{REAL_POLY_POW_CONV} is a more delicate conversion that, given a term
{p1 pow n} where {p} is a real polynomial in normal form and {n} a numeral,
returns a theorem {|- p pow n = p'} where {p'} is in normal form.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not a real term raised to a numeral power.
If the subterm is not a polynomial in normal form, the overall normalization is
not guaranteed.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # REAL_POLY_POW_CONV `(x + &1) pow 4`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (x + &1) pow 4 = x pow 4 + &4 * x pow 3 + &6 * x pow 2 + &4 * x + &1
}

\USES
More delicate polynomial operations that simply the direct normalization with
{REAL_POLY_CONV}.
