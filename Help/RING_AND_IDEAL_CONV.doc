\DOC RING_AND_IDEAL_CONV

\TYPE {RING_AND_IDEAL_CONV : (term -> num) * (num -> term) * conv * term * term * term * term * term * term * term * thm * (term -> thm) -> (term -> thm) * (term list -> term -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a pair giving a ring proof procedure and an ideal membership routine.

\DESCRIBE
This function combines the functionality of {RING} and {ideal_cofactors}. Each
of these requires the same rather lengthy input. When you want to apply both to
the same set of parameters, you can do so using {RING_AND_IDEAL_CONV}. That is:
{
  RING_AND_IDEAL_CONV parms
}
\noindent is functionally equivalent to:
{
  RING parms,ideal_cofactors parms
}
For more information, see the documentation for those two functions.

\FAILURE
Fails if the parameters are wrong.

\SEEALSO
ideal_cofactors, RING.
