\DOC conjuncts

\TYPE {conjuncts : term -> term list}

\SYNOPSIS
Iteratively breaks apart a conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
If a term {t} is a conjunction {p /\ q}, then {conjuncts t} will recursively
break down {p} and {q} into conjuncts and append the resulting lists. Otherwise
it will return the singleton list {[t]}. So if {t} is of the form
{t1 /\ ... /\ tn} with any reassociation, no {ti} itself being a conjunction,
the list returned will be {[t1; ...; tn]}. But
{
   conjuncts(list_mk_conj([t1;...;tn]))
}
\noindent will not return {[t1;...;tn]} if any of {t1},...,{tn} is a
conjunction.

\FAILURE
Never fails, even if the term is not boolean.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # conjuncts `((p /\ q) /\ r) /\ ((p /\ s /\ t) /\ u)`;;
  val it : term list = [`p`; `q`; `r`; `p`; `s`; `t`; `u`]

  # conjuncts(list_mk_conj [`a /\ b`; `c:bool`; `d /\ e /\ f`]);;
  val it : term list = [`a`; `b`; `c`; `d`; `e`; `f`]
}

\COMMENTS
Because {conjuncts} splits both the left and right sides of a conjunction,
this operation is not the inverse of {list_mk_conj}. You can also use
{splitlist dest_conj} to split in a right-associated way only.
