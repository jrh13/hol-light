\DOC term_match

\TYPE {term_match : term list -> term -> term -> instantiation}

\SYNOPSIS
Match one term against another.

\DESCRIBE
The call {term_match lcs t t'} attempts to find an instantiation for free
variables in {t}, not permitting assignment of `local constant' variables in
the list {lcs}, so that it is alpha-equivalent to {t'}. If it succeeds, the
appropriate instantiation is returned. Otherwise it fails. The matching is
higher-order in a limited sense; see {PART_MATCH} for more illustrations.

\FAILURE
Fails if terms cannot be matched.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # term_match [] `x + y + 1` `(y + 1) + z + 1`;;
  val it : instantiation = ([], [(`z`, `y`); (`y + 1`, `x`)], [])

  # term_match [] `~(?x:A. P x)` `~(?n. 5 < n /\ n < 6)`;;
  val it : instantiation =
    ([(1, `P`)], [(`\n. 5 < n /\ n < 6`, `P`)], [(`:num`, `:A`)])
}

\COMMENTS
This function can occasionally `succeed' yet produce a match that does not in
fact work. In typical uses, this will be implicitly checked by a subsequent
inference process. However, to get a self-contained matching effect, the user
should check that the instantiation returned does achieve a match, e.g. by
applying {instantiate}.
