\DOC variant

\TYPE {variant : term list -> term -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
Modifies a variable name to avoid clashes.

\DESCRIBE
The call {variant avoid v} returns a variant of {v}, with the name changed by
adding primes as much as necessary to avoid clashing with any free variables of
the terms in the list {avoid}. Usually {avoid} is just a list of variables, in
which case {v} is renamed so as to be different from all of them.

The exact form of the variable name should not be relied on, except that the
original variable will be returned unmodified unless it is free in some term in
the {avoid} list.

\FAILURE
{variant l t} fails if any term in the list {l} is not a variable or if
{t} is neither a variable nor a constant.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows a few typical cases:
{
  # variant [`y:bool`; `z:bool`] `x:bool`;;
  val it : term = `x`

  # variant [`x:bool`; `x':num`; `x'':num`] `x:bool`;;
  val it : term = `x'`

  # variant [`x:bool`; `x':bool`; `x'':bool`] `x:bool`;;
  val it : term = `x'''`
}

\USES
The function {variant} is extremely useful for complicated derived rules which
need to rename variables to avoid free variable capture while still making the
role of the variable obvious to the user.
