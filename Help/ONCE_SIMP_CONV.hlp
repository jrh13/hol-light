\DOC ONCE_SIMP_CONV

\TYPE {ONCE_SIMP_CONV : thm list -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplify a term once by conditional contextual rewriting.

\DESCRIBE
A call {ONCE_SIMP_CONV thl tm} will return {|- tm = tm'} where {tm'} results
from applying the theorems in {thl} as (conditional) rewrite rules, as well as
built-in simplifications (see {basic_rewrites} and {basic_convs}). For more
details on this kind of conditional rewriting, see {SIMP_TAC}. The {ONCE}
prefix indicates that the first applicable terms in a toplevel term will be
simplified once only, though conditional subgoals generated will be simplified
repeatedly.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but may return a reflexive theorem {|- tm = tm} if no
simplifications can be made.
