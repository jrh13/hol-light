\TYPE {pretype_of_type : hol_type -> pretype}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a type into a pretype.

\DESCRIBE
HOL Light uses ``pretypes'' and ``preterms'' as intermediate structures for
parsing and typechecking, which are later converted to types and terms. A call
{preterm_of_term `tm`} converts in the other direction, from a normal HOL term
back to a preterm.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
User manipulation of pretypes is not usually necessary, unless you seek to
radically change aspects of parsing and typechecking.

\SEEALSO
preterm_of_term, type_of_pretype.
