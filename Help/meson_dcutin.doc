\DOC meson_dcutin

\TYPE {meson_dcutin : int ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Determines cut-in point for divide-and-conquer refinement in {MESON}.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of several parameters determining the behavior of {MESON},
{MESON_TAC} and related rules and tactics. This number (by default 1)
determines the number of current subgoals at which point a special
divide-and-conquer refinement will be invoked.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\USES
For users requiring fine control over the algorithms used in {MESON}'s
first-order proof search.

\COMMENTS
For more details of this optimization, see Harrison's paper ``Optimizing
Proof Search in Model Elimination'', CADE-13, 1996.
