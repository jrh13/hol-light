\TYPE {type_invention_warning : bool ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Determined if user is warned about invented type variables.

\DESCRIBE
If HOL Light is unable to assign specific types to a term entered in quotation,
it will invent its own type variables to use in the most general type. The flag
{type_invention_warning} determines whether the user is warned in such
situations. The default is {true}, since this can often indicate a user error
(e.g. the user forgot to define a constant before using it in a term or
overlooked more general types than expected). But to disable the warnings, set
it to {false}.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\EXAMPLE
When the following term is entered, HOL Light invents a type variable to use as
the most general type:
{
  # let tm = `x IN s`;;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val tm : term = `x IN s`
}
\noindent which are not particularly intuitive, as you can see:
{
  # map dest_var (frees tm);;
  val it : (string * hol_type) list =
    [("x", `:?47676`); ("s", `:?47676->bool`)]
}
\noindent You can avoid this by explicitly giving appropriate types or type
variables yourself:
{
  # let tm = `(x:A) IN s`;;
  val tm : term = `x IN s`
}
But if you often want to let HOL Light invent types for itself without warning
you, set
{
  # type_invention_warning := false;;
  val it : unit = ()
}
One reason why you might find the warning more irritating than helpful is if
you are rewriting with ad-hoc set theory lemmas generated like this:
{
  # SET_RULE `x IN UNIONS (a INSERT t) <=> x IN UNIONS t \/ x IN a`;;
}
