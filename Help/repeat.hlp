\TYPE {repeat : ('a -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a}

\SYNOPSIS
Repeatedly apply a function until it fails.

\DESCRIBE
The call {repeat f x} successively applies {f} over and over again starting
with {x}, and stops at the first point when a {Failure _} exception occurs.

\FAILURE
Never fails. If {f} fails at once it returns {x}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # repeat (snd o dest_forall) `!x y z. x + y + z < 1`;;
  val it : term = `x + y + z < 1`
}

\COMMENTS
If you know exactly how many times you want to apply it, you may prefer
{funpow}.

\SEEALSO
