\DOC binops

\TYPE {binops : term -> term -> term list}

\SYNOPSIS
Repeatedly breaks apart an iterated binary operator into components.

\DESCRIBE
The call {binops op t} repeatedly breaks down applications of the binary
operator {op} within {t}. If {t} is of the form {(op l) r} (thinking of {op} as
infix, {l op r}), then it recursively breaks down {l} and {r} in the same way
and appends the results. Otherwise, a singleton list of the original term is
returned.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # binops `(+):num->num->num` `((1 + 2) + 3) + 4 + 5 + 6`;;
  val it : term list = [`1`; `2`; `3`; `4`; `5`; `6`]

  # binops `(+):num->num->num` `F`;;
  val it : term list = [`F`]
}
