\DOC GENERAL_REWRITE_CONV

\TYPE {GENERAL_REWRITE_CONV : bool -> (conv -> conv) -> gconv net -> thm list -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrite with theorems as well as an existing net.

\DESCRIBE
The call {GENERAL_REWRITE_CONV b cnvl net thl} will regard {thl} as rewrite
rules, and if {b = true}, also potentially as conditional rewrite rules. These
extra rules will be incorporated into the existing {net}, and rewriting applied
with a search strategy {cnvl} (e.g. {DEPTH_CONV}).

\COMMENTS
This is mostly for internal use, but it can sometimes be more efficient when
rewriting with large sets of theorems repeatedly if they are first composed
into a net and then augmented like this.
