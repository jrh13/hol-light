\TYPE {SELECT_ELIM_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminate select terms from a goal.

\DESCRIBE
The tactic {SELECT_ELIM_TAC} attempts to remove from a goal any select terms,
i.e. instances of the Hilbert choice operator {@x. P[x]}. First, any instances
that occur inside their own predicate, i.e. {P[@x. P[x]]}, are replaced simply
by {?x. P[x]}, as with {SELECT_CONV}. Other select-terms are eliminated by
replacing each on with a new variable {v} and adding a corresponding instance
of the axiom {SELECT_AX}, of the form {!x. P[x] ==> P[v]}. Note that the latter
does not strictly preserve logical equivalence, only implication. So it is
possible to replace a provable goal by an unprovable one. But since not much is
provable about a select term except via the axiom {SELECT_AX}, this is not
likely in practice.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
Suppose we set the goal:
{
  # g `(@n. n < 3) < 3 /\ (@n. n < 3) < 5`;;
}
\noindent An application of {SELECT_ELIM_TAC} returns:
{
  # e SELECT_ELIM_TAC;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!_73133. (!x. x < 3 ==> _73133 < 3) ==> (?n. n < 3) /\ _73133 < 5`
}

\USES
This is already applied as an initial normalization by {MESON} and other rules.
Users may occasionally find it helpful.
