\DOC follow_path

\TYPE {follow_path : string -> term -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
Find the subterm of a given term indicated by a path.

\DESCRIBE
A call {follow_path p t} follows path {p} inside {t} and returns the subterm
encountered. The path is a string with the successive characters interpreted as
follows:

\begin{{itemize}}

\item {"b"}: take the body of an abstraction

\item {"l"}: take the left (rator) path in an application

\item {"r"}: take the right (rand) path in an application

\end{{itemize}}

\FAILURE
Fails if the path is not meaningful for the term, e.g. if a {"b"} is
encountered for a subterm that is not an abstraction.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # follow_path "rrlr" `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5`;;
  val it : term = `3`
}
