All code in this directory is distributed under the same license as
HOL Light (BSD-2-Clause).

This code implements and extends for HOL Light some of the classic
techniques due to Boyer and Moore for automating inductive proofs. It
is written by Petros Papapanagiotou and is described in his MSc thesis
"On the Automation of Inductive Proofs in HOL Light", available
online:

  http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/publications/thesis/online/IM070466.pdf

The code builds on earlier work by Richard Boulton in HOL88; see
"Boyer-Moore automation for the HOL System", Proceedings of
the International Workshop on Higher Order Logic Theorem Proving
and its Application pp. 133-142, North-Holland 1992.
