\TYPE {aconv : term -> term -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests for alpha-convertibility of terms.

\KEYWORDS
alpha.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to two terms, {aconv} returns {true} if they are
alpha-convertible, and {false} otherwise.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
A simple case of alpha-convertibility is the renaming of a single quantified
variable:
{
  # aconv `?x. x <=> T` `?y. y <=> T`;;
  val it : bool = true
}
but other cases can be more involved:
{
# aconv `\x y z. x + y + z` `\y x z. y + x + z`;;
val it : bool = true
}

\COMMENTS
The code for alpha-conversion first checks for simple equality with pointer 
equality shortcutting, and can therefore often returns {true} without a full 
traversal.

In principle, most of the HOL Light deductive apparatus should work modulo 
alpha-conversion. At least, all the primitive inference rules do.
