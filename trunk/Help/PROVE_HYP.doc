\DOC PROVE_HYP

\TYPE {PROVE_HYP : thm -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates a provable assumption from a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, assumption.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to two theorems, {PROVE_HYP} gives a new theorem with the
conclusion of the second and the union of the assumption list minus the
conclusion of the first theorem.
{
     A1 |- t1     A2 |- t2
   -------------------------  PROVE_HYP
     A1 u (A2 - {{t1}}) |- t2
}
If {t1} does not occurr in {A2} then the function simply returns the second
theorem {A2 |- t2} unchanged without including the assumptions {A1}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # let th1 = CONJUNCT2(ASSUME `p /\ q /\ r`)
    and th2 = CONJUNCT2(ASSUME `q /\ r`);;
  val th1 : thm = p /\ q /\ r |- q /\ r
  val th2 : thm = q /\ r |- r

  # PROVE_HYP th1 th2;;
  val it : thm = p /\ q /\ r |- r
}

\COMMENTS
This is sometimes known as the Cut rule. Although it is not necessary for the
conclusion of the first theorem to be the same as an assumption of the second,
{PROVE_HYP} is otherwise of doubtful value.
